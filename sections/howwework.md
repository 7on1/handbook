# How We Work

## Async by default

As a remote-working company, we resort to being async by default. That means, you should never expect immediate response from anyone, and we favour asynchronous communication like a good Basecamp post or written communication on Slack over calls.

## Videocalls

Despite the above, we have to communicate sometimes in a synchronous mode. When scheduling a call with someone, we will prioritise having the video on to create more rapport with clients and to bond deeper with teammates.

Try to keep the calls short and on point and be respectful of everyone's time.

## Tools

_A grosso modo_ we use the following tools:

* __1password__: For passwords and credentials management.
* __Google Suite__: For docs and mail and calendar, but you can use your own provided they integrate with one another!
* __Basecamp__: For project management and internal one-to-many communication and reporting.
* __Slack__: For one-to-one communication, screensharing and videocalls, and also to communicate with a few clients who want to have it.
* __Github__: Where we store our code and we also use it to manage the tasks and the projects from a technical perspective.
* __Harvest/Forecast__: Where we track our hours and where we plan ahead. We're also using it to get reports and to invoice clients.
* __Hubspot__: We use it for certain marketing purposes and to track the dealflow and to report on sales.
