# How We Work

## Remote

We are a remote working company. That means that we don’t have an office where we everyday work from.

Being remote means:

* You can work from home.
* You can work from somebody else’s home.
* You can work from your favourite coffee shop (just don’t be a Starbucks guy)
* You can work from the beach.
* You can work while you’re travelling.
* You can work from the local library.
* You can work from a Caribbean island.
* You can work from a coworking space.
* You can work from Mars.
* You can work from our future offices, if we decide to rent them.
* Etc.

Being remote does not mean:

* Working only from home.
* Isolating from people.
* Working in only quiet places.
* Being available all the time.
* Etc.

We believe in responsibility. We are all adults. As long as work gets done, we don’t care where you do it from.

## Async by default

As a remote-working company, we resort to being async by default. That means, you should never expect immediate response from anyone, and we favour asynchronous communication like a good Basecamp post or written communication on Slack over calls.

## Open communication

Most one-on-one communication happens over Slack. In order to be all on the same page, we will ask you that you write always on public channels so information is easily accessible for everyone.

This way, we also avoid clients being too intense on private conversations.

If you want to talk about strictly private stuff, then this is a good occasion to do it privately.

## Videocalls

Despite the above, we have to communicate sometimes in a synchronous mode. When scheduling a call with someone, we will prioritise having the video on to create more rapport with clients and to bond deeper with teammates.

Try to keep the calls short and on point and be respectful of everyone's time.

## Languages

Since we've got clients from abroad and clients from all over Spain, we use English and Spanish almost indistinctly.

__Things we do in English__:

* We code and document always in English with no exception.
* We post on Basecamp only in English too.
* Our Startup Grind events and conferences.
* Social media content.
* We have English Fridays on Slack, where we are only allowed to write in English.
* Communication with foreign clients.
* All the content on the corporate website.

__Things we do in Spanish__:

* Most internal communication on Slack.
* Communication with Spanish-speaking clients.
* Most content on the website is translated to Spanish, except for the blog.

In the company presentations we do at the Martian Days, we speak meme.

## Tools

_A grosso modo_ we use the following tools:

* __1password__: For passwords and credentials management.
* __Google Suite__: For docs and mail and calendar, but you can use your own provided they integrate with one another!
* __Basecamp__: For project management and internal one-to-many communication and reporting.
* __Slack__: For one-to-one communication, screensharing and videocalls, and also to communicate with a few clients who want to have it.
* __Github__: Where we store our code and we also use it to manage the tasks and the projects from a technical perspective.
* __Harvest/Forecast__: Where we track our hours and where we plan ahead. We're also using it to get reports and to invoice clients.
* __Hubspot__: We use it for certain marketing purposes and to track the dealflow and to report on sales.
