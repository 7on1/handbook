# What Influenced Us

We, Martians, have a very distinct way of seeing the world. However, we're not alone in this. A few companies and individuals came before us and cleared the path, coined new terms and devised disruptive ways to work which inspired us to create our company and to work as we do.

## Companies

* __Basecamp__: The ultimate reason why we created our company. Their books, mentioned below, their company philosophy, the way they work, their love for the remote and their blunt opinions on the crazy startup madness are just a few of all the things we like about them.
* __Thoughtbot__: Every consultancy should aspire to become like thoughtbot. Not only are they the leading Rails consultancy, but their open-source projects are used by many, their podcast is brilliant and their website and quality standards have been a large inspiration for us throughout the years.
* __Buffer__: One of the very first big companies to embrace the radical transparency mode and their 100%-remote philosophy. The way we blog is largely influenced by these one-of-a-kind folks.

## Books

* __Rework__ and __Remote: No Office Required__: Both written by Jason Fried and DHH, the co-founders of Basecamp. Those books provided the epiphany that we could (and quite possibly, should) create a _different_ company. Most of our culture and workflows are based on these two books.

## People

* __Derek Andersen__: He envisioned the largest community of entrepreneurs worlwide and he's building it with a set of values we share: helping others before helping oneself, making friends and not connections, and giving before taking.
* __David Bowie__: Contrary to popular belief, he was not the main inspiration behind our company name. But deep in our hearts, we know he _might_ have something to do with it.
