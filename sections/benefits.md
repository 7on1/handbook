# Benefits & Perks

Being a __MarsBased__ employee comes with a lot of benefits.

Our commitment with you is to provide you with the best tools, setup and environment to work.

As a MarsBased employee, you get:

* __100% remote__: Our company is conceived and prepared to be 100% remote by default. All the tools and workflows we use adapt to this philosophy.
* __Flesible hours__: Our schedule is 100% flexible so you can adapt it whenever needed.
* __Flexible time off__: We don't check how many days you take off. Make sure you coordinate with your team and enjoy some well-deserved time off.
* __No overtime__: You will work a maximum of 40h per week. This is a marathon, not a 100-meter sprint. We need you sane and healthy for the long ride.
* __Choose your flavour__: You define your laptop's specs. By default, we recommend using a Mac, but we're open to adapt to you.
* __Office material__: The fact that we don't have an office doesn't mean that you shouldn't have one. We will cover the costs of your office material, such as a desk, a secondary screen, a chair, etc. (use sensibly).
* __Language courses__: We give every employee up to USD 100 per month to use on iTalki to learn languages.
* __Paid coworking__: If working from home isn't your thing and you want to work from a coworking space, we will give you an allowance of 200 euro per month so you can choose whichever suits you best.
* __Tickets for conferences__: We sometimes go to conferences. We'll be happy to cover for the costs of that as well.
* __Company retreat__: Once per year, we do a company off-site away from Barcelona to enjoy of a few days together in a different environment.
* __Martian Days__: Every 2-3 months, we meet for a couple of days in Barcelona for a company get-together. We share the numbers of the company, strategy, interesting new projects, we conduct workshops and internal trainings and much more.
* __Zerg Rush__: A few times a year, we do an 8h online hackathon the entire team to work on internal and side projects.
* __Books__: We'll buy you a few books when you start working with us so you get acquainted with how we work and what we do. If you need to purchase any other book for work, let us know!
* __Christmas dinner and other surprises__: End of the year, start of the party! Our Christmas dinners (and the subsequent parties) are legendary. We also give a few Christmas gifts and some other surprises during the year.
