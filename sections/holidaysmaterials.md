# Requesting Holidays & Materials

## Sick leave and time off

Everybody needs to go to the doctor. 

Everybody needs to be at home when the repairman/plumber/DSL technician/etc comes and might be easily distracted.

Sometimes our most loved ones need to be taken care of.

You might want to take a train to go for a long weekend on Friday but will be splitting the day in two.

There are a million reason why we have flexible schedules. Just drop us a line like “hey guys, Wednesday morning I might be off for three hours, I will catch up later” and that’s fine. A message on Slack on the #status channel will do.

Same for sick leave. Just let us know and rest a lot. We wish we could help you more with that.

Same applies to the holidays and vacation: want to take a day off? do it. “Hey guys, next Monday I won’t be in town. Don’t contact me”. You know when you can take some time off and how to manage your time.

For periods longer than two weeks, we just ask that you let us know with enough time to adjust the calendar & project planning. A couple of months before is OK.

We actually have a thread for that on Basecamp. Leire will add that to Harvest so we can all be on the same page, but make sure it's right, if you're so kind!

## Local holidays

We normally take Barcelona’s local holidays as our calendar, but we don’t want to force anybody to follow them. It is, however, advisable, in order to keep aligned with your team mates.

But feel free to exchange any local holidays for another normal day, any time. Flexibility, remember.

## Requesting office material & other stuff

Contact Leire to request office material and other stuff you might need. She's the catalyser of everything in the company.

We don't need a compicated process for this, do we?
