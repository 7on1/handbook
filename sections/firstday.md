# First day

Welcome aboard! It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the MarsBased spaceship. Before proceeding to your tasks, this first chapter will help to you get set up in the company.

Make sure you've read the welcome PDF and that you've got access to the main tools: Slack, Basecamp, 1password and your email. The rest of the tools, you can find them in our [Tools](/tools.md) section.

By now, almost everything is set & ready. If you haven’t sent all of this, please do it:

* Your address.
* Phone number.
* Bank account.
* Twitter handle (preferably a “professional” one)
* LinkedIn profile.
* Github username.
* A picture for the website.
* A couple of fun facts about you for your bio (2 lines max).
