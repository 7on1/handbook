# Our Rituals

Even though we're a 100%-remote company, we do a few activities both offline and online. Let's describe them!

## Martian Day

Every two months, more or less, we fly everyone in and we meet for a day of get-together.

In the Martian Days we don't do client work, and we spend quality time sharing the numbers of the company, doing AMA sessions, workshops, keynotes, brainstormings and a few leisure activities like football matches, dinners and more!

Needless to say, the company pays for the flights, meals and accommodation.

In Winter, we wrap our Martian Day with a Christmas dinner and a good party.

## Zerg Rush

In alternate months between Martian Days, we do our online hackathon called __Zerg Rush__, honouring one of our favourite games ever: Starcraft.

Typically on Fridays, we meet online at 9am to distribute tasks and work on internal projects: our product Rosetta, documentation, libraries, open source, a new website, etc.

We do another followup call at the end of the day to summarise what we've been up to and in which state are we leaving the project.

We tend to organise people in small groups with other team members they usually don't work with so they get more acquainted with one another.

Once, our frontend developer Javier Artero went to the coworking for a Zerg Rush and found nobody there ðŸ¤£

## Martian Retreat

Once a year, we do a company retreat. A couple of years back, our developer Oriol came up with this great idea and we let him organise it.

The idea is to go somewhere for a couple of working days (fly in and Martian Day on Thursday, and Zerg Rush on Friday) and then the more adventurous can enjoy a weekend away, too, if they want.

So far, we've done the following:

* __2019:__ Menorca.
* __2019:__ Dublin.
* __2017:__ Tenerife.

## Coworking Wednesdays

Those in Barcelona meet every Wednesdays at Spaces 22@ (C/Pallars 193,Â 08005, Barcelona). We've got a partnership with them to work from there once per week.

It's a great occasion to get more acquainted with people, as we go together for breakfast, lunch and occasionally for some beers at the end of the day.

## Martian Tapas

The development team meet online every Thursday to discuss tech.

You will find more information about this practice on this blog post: [Going for Martian Tapas With our Distributed Development Team](https://marsbased.com/blog/2018/12/10/martian-tapas-remote-dev-team/).

## Spotify contest & English Friday

Being a small company which operates remotely for the most part means that we interact less frequently face-to-face than what most of us would like.

We try to spice up Fridays by chatting only in English and by playing our Spotify contest we describe on this blog post: [A Team Bonding Activity for Remote Teams Using Spotify](https://marsbased.com/blog/2019/04/29/team-bonding-activity-remote-teams-using-spotify/).

## Reading challenge

A few people in the company have engaged in a reading challenge. At the beginning of the year, we set a number of books we want to read and we share it on [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com).

There's no winner and no rules, just the pleasure of reading.

Have you got other ideas? A few of these were brought up by employees and now they're an integral part of our culture. Feel free to suggest good ideas!
