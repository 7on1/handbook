# Our Product: Rosetta

In 2019, we've started to develop our first product: __Rosetta__.

Rosetta is a tool for HR companies and departments to assess the language skills of their candidates.

## Current status

The project is still being developed and therefore we don't have much to share. We plan to launch an MVP before the end of the year.

## Technologies

Once the MVP is developed, we will share more technical details about it.

## Who's working on it?

We are working on it as a side-project inside the MarsBased hours, during every edition of the Zerg Rush. Therefore, the development pace is slow but steady.

## Why are we doing it?

We wanted to explore the product side of business. We have developed dozens of products for other companies, so we wanted to venture in our own. We also want to diversify our income, and we thought that creating our own product would bring a different type of revenue.

We also want to make the recruitment world a bit more efficient and better by using technology and a different perspective.
